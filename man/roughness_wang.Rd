\arguments{
\item{x}{Object to analyse,
which will be coerced to an object of class
\code{\link[hrep]{fr_sparse_spectrum}}.
Various input types are possible:
\itemize{
\item Numeric vectors will be treated as vectors of MIDI note numbers,
which will be expanded into their implied harmonics.
\item A two-element list can be used to define a harmonic spectrum.
The first element should be a vector of frequencies in Hz,
the second a vector of amplitudes.
\item The function also accepts classes from the \code{hrep} package,
such as produced by \code{\link[hrep]{pi_chord}()} and
\code{\link[hrep]{fr_sparse_spectrum}()}.
}}

\item{detail}{(Logical scalar) Whether to return detailed output information.}

\item{include_phase_impact_factors}{(Logical scalar)
Whether to include phase impact factors in roughness computation.
Set to \code{TRUE} to recover the original specifications of Wang et al. (2013).
However, disabling this feature (by leaving the parameter at \code{FALSE})
seems to result in better estimation of perceptual consonance.}

\item{unit_amplitude_in_dB}{(Numeric scalar)
Determines the decibel level of a partial with amplitude 1.
When the input is a musical chord,
this will correspond to the decibel level of the fundamental frequencies
of each chord tone.}

\item{msg}{Function to be called to give progress updates.
This function should accept three arguments:
\code{n}, an integer identifying the current position in the pipeline,
\code{N}, an integer identifying the length of the pipeline,
and \code{msg}, a string providing a longer-format description
of the current position in the pipeline.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to pass to
\code{\link[hrep]{fr_sparse_spectrum}}.}
}
\value{
If \code{detail == FALSE}, a numeric vector of roughnesses,
otherwise a list containing detailed algorithm output.
}
\description{
Gets the roughness of a sonority according to the model of Wang et al. (2013).
}
\note{
This implementation is designed for sparse input spectra, that is,
spectra containing only a few (< 100) components.
